# Enigma-Testing-Suite-CCP
A secure, console-based examination system built in C++ featuring role-based login, encrypted data storage, and dynamic quiz management using Linked Lists and File I/O.

Enigma is a robust, console-based application designed to simulate a secure digital testing environment. Built as a collaborative academic project, it demonstrates core Computer Science concepts including Data Structures (Linked Lists), File Handling, and Basic Cryptography.

Key Features
Role-Based Access Control: Distinct workflows for Admins (Teachers) and Users (Students).

Secure Authentication: Custom XOR-based encryption to protect user credentials and score data.

Dynamic Quiz Engine: Uses Linked Lists to efficiently manage and traverse questions during runtime.

Persistent Storage: Saves all questions, users, and results to local files (.txt), ensuring data is never lost.

Performance Analytics: automatically generates a leaderboard and calculates class averages.
